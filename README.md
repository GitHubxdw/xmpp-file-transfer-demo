File Transfer using XMPPFramework
=================================

This application is merely a brief demo of how to use the file transfer extension of the XMPPFramework.

Note that it uses [my specific fork](https://github.com/jonstaff/XMPPFramework) of the XMPPFramework unless/until they pull it into the master repo.  I'll update this readme accordingly if that happens.

Both incoming file transfers and outgoing file transfers are functional within this demo, but I've left a significant amount of error-handling out, so you'll want to include that in your app.
